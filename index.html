	<h1 class="sitemessage">NaM is an emote commonly used on Twitch that can only be seen by BetterTTV users. Sources suggest that the word ‘NaM’ is an acronym for ‘Non-Asian minority’, which is usually used to describe a person who is referred to as a member of a minority that is not from Asian backgrounds. Though many other people suggest that the word NaM, does not have an actual meaning.

The emote itself features a young man, guessed to be in his 20’s, wearing a headset with a slight smile on his face. There has been no research as to who this person could be, but even though we may never know, people still love the emote and use it on a daily basis.

NaM is a global BetterTTV emote. This means that the streamer does not have to enable the emote, and it can be freely used in any chat. People often use NaM to spam various messages. What differentiates NaM from the other emotes, is that the emote is especially big. Along with it being a 3-character emote. This gives it great spamming potential, because streamers usually limit their viewers in the messages they can send.

Besides spamming, there are also multiple instances where a viewer could spam NaM, such as when the country of Vietnam is mentioned. This being of course because the last 3 letters of the word spell NaM. The emote could also be used to fill up the streamers chatbox, or to rival the fellow spammers. This has resulted in many cases where people would send messages quoting: “SHUTTHEFUCKUPWEEBS NaM SHUTTHEFUCKUPWEEBS NaM SHUTTHEFUCKUPWEEBS NaM SHUTTHEFUCKUPWEEBS NaM SHUTTHEFUCKUPWEEBS NaM SHUTTHEFUCKUPWEEBS NaM SHUTTHEFUCKUPWEEBS NaM SHUTTHEFUCKUPWEEBS NaM SHUTTHEFUCKUPWEEBS NaM SHUTTHEFUCKUPWEEBS NaM SHUTTHEFUCKUPWEEBS NaM”.

As I have mentioned before, NaM is only visible by users of the BetterTTV Chrome add-on, or Chatterino users. This means that the average Twitch viewer cannot see the emote, and are often confused when confronted by the large amounts of spam. Many streamers have, because of the spam, banned NaM in their viewers messages. Although this does not stop the so-called ‘Nammers’. They would keep spamming their NaM’s until the bots, that regulate the chat, would stop properly functioning. On a rare occasion, the message containing a NaM could be completely skipped, and the user would not get a time-out for his or her message.

The emote shines in chatrooms who prefer cancer over a normal chat experience. Such as popular racist streamer ‘forsen’, also known as ‘forsenlol’, ‘forsensc’ and ‘forsen1337’. This particular streamer has recently upped the NaM banphrase from only 10 seconds, to a whopping 30 seconds, leading to a riot of the Nammers. Even with this punishing banphrase, the banned messages can still be seen for a short period of time, and these messages still fill up most of the chat, until they disappear and get replaced by a message that reads: message deleted.
